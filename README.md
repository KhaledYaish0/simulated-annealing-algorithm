# simulated-annealing-algorithm
-This project aims to develop a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize delivery truck
routes with the goal of minimizing total travel distance. The focus is on solving the Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP) efficiently.
-The objective is to implement a simulated annealing algorithm to solve the VRP. This
involves determining the optimal routes that minimize the total travel distance while
adhering to truck capacity constraints
